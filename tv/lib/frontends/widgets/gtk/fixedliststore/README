This directory contains the miro.frontends.widgets.gtk.fixedliststore module.

The meat of the code is in fixed-list-store.c and fixed-list-store.h, which
implement the GtkTreeModel in C.

That code gets wrapped by pygtk to create a python module.  A couple of these
files are auto-built by the pygobject code generation system:

fixed-list-store.defs:
  - build using generate-defs.sh
  - build info is stored in build-info-defs

fixed-list-store-wrapper.c:
  - build using generate-wrapper.sh
  - controled by the fixed-list-store.override file
  - build info is store in build-info-wrapper

fixed-list-store-module.c defines the module that stores the wrapper code.

Lastly there's setup-test.py and setup.py which work together to build a quick
python program to test the code.
