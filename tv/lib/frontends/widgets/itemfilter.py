"""itemfilter.py -- Filter out items from item lists

ItemFilter is a base class for item filters.  They handle determining what
items should be filtered out of an item list.  They also handle
selecting/deselecting other ItemFilters when they are first activated (most
filters deselect all other filters, but some can be used together).

ItemFilterSet handles keeping track of what filters are available and which
are selected for a given item list.
